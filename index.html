        <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of
            <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a
            well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the
            longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
        </p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming
            that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her
            pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be
            an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>

            <p>Eggs are one of my favourite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1tbs butter</li>
                <li>2tbs cream</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat</li>
                <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
                <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</li>
                <li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if you are
                    making an omelette)</li>
                <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue to cook on the plate until
                    served)</li>
